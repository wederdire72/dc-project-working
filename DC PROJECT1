<h1>DC UNIVERSE</H1>
<p>The DC Universe (DCU) is the fictional shared universe where the stories in most American comic book titles published by DC Comics take place. DC superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and The Flash and etc, are from this universe, and it also contains well known supervillains such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Harley Quinn, and Gorrila Grodd. Note that in context, "DC Universe" is usually used to refer to the main DC continuity. Occasionally, "DC Universe" will be used to indicate the "DC Multiverse", the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications.</p><br>

<p> There are not only more than dozens of super heroes in the dc universe multiverese, but as many super villians aswell. This will create not only problems but a kind of natura flow to the way these super heroes present themselves to the public. Some super heroes just go out and dont care if the world knows there identity but others such as superman(Clark Kent), decide to keep it a mystery and/or a seret.</p>

<p> For every super hero there is atleast one super villian and for most there are more than one.</P>

<h1> As you can see above there is a picture of the one, the only,...... Superman.<br></h1>
<h1> A little history of superman would be...<br></h1>
<p>Superman's appearance is distinctive and iconic; he usually wears a blue costume, red cape, and stylized red-and-yellow "S" shield on his chest. This shield is used in a myriad of media to symbolize the character. The origin story of Superman relates that he was born Kal-El on the planet Krypton, before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction. Discovered and adopted by a Kansas farmer and his wife, the child is raised as Clark Kent and imbued with a strong moral compass. Very early on he started to display superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity. Superman resides and operates in the fictional American city of Metropolis. As Clark Kent, Superman's secret identity, he is a journalist for the Daily Planet, a Metropolis newspaper. Superman's primary love interest is Lois Lane, and his archenemy is supervillain Lex Luthor.</p>

<p> Why did i pick superman to write about? This is because superman is the main character along with i believe like 2-4 others of the DC universe franchise. This is not because of any specific powers or abilities they may have ut because they are the most loved, rooted for by all od the franchises fans. Now dont get me wron the other non main vcharacters are still rooted for my hundreds maybe even thousands but, the main characters are the "main" characters for a reason whether for unfair choosing oroccess or for marketing purposes they are the main in which everyone knows about.</p>
